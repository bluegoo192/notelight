# notelite

Simple note project I started to learn Vue.js.   Someday I may try and release it, since most note apps seem pretty bloated.  

## Instructions
~~Just go to lightnote.azurewebsites.net.  Be warned though:
* I'm using the slowest tier of hosting, which turns off the server when not in use.  So initial load will be very slow~~ Website is currently offline until another hosting service is provided.
* Many features, like login and folders, don't work yet.  However, the notes themselves work fine
* Dragging notes doesn't work properly in Chrome(I use Firefox, and since this is a personal project I haven't gotten around to fixing Chrome bugs)

## Features
* Instant, hassle-free autosaving to local storage
* Floating, draggable, resizable note windows
* Clean, minimalist appearance inspired by Material Design
* Fast and light, unlike most competitors
